# Landing Page Draft: Biohacker Pro

## 1. Hero Section
**Headline**: Most health apps look like games. Biohacker Pro looks like medicine.
**Sub-headline**: Transform your messy Apple Health export into clinical-grade reports that doctors actually respect. One-time lifetime unlock for $199.

## 2. Problem: The "Neon Data" Trap (Anti-Demo Hook)
Apple Health is great for counting steps, but it's a disaster for clinical conversations. When you show your doctor a screen full of neon bars and "moving rings," they don't see data—they see consumer noise.
**The Problem**: Your most valuable data—your blood pressure, heart rate variability, and respiratory logs—is trapped in a UI built for scrolling, not for clinical auditing.

## 3. Solution: The Physician-Ready Clinical Audit (Fallback Narrative)
Biohacker Pro is the professional layer for `applehealthdata.com`. It's a clean, clinical interface that speaks the language of medicine. No fluff. No gamification. Just the data, decoded.
