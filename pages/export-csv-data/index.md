# Export Apple Health Data to CSV (iPhone + iCloud Guide)

Your iPhone is a treasure trove of health data, but accessing it in a usable format can be a frustrating experience. If you've ever wanted to analyze your fitness trends in a spreadsheet, share data with a health professional, or create a secure backup, you know the value of a clean CSV file. This guide provides a definitive, step-by-step process for creating an **Apple Health CSV export** directly from your iPhone.

## Why Exporting Directly to CSV is a Game-Changer

*   **Immediately Usable:** Open your health history directly in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Apple Numbers.
*   **Easy to Analyze:** Every data type is organized into neat rows and columns, perfect for sorting, filtering, and creating charts.
*   **Simple to Share:** Provide a universally compatible file to your doctor, physical therapist, or running coach.
*   **Archive-Ready:** CSV is a plain-text format, making it ideal for a long-term, incorruptible **[Apple Health data backup](/pages/apple-health-backup/)**.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How is the CSV file structured?
The CSV file is structured in a "long" format, which is ideal for data analysis. Each row represents a single data point (e.g., one heart rate reading, a step count for a specific minute). Columns typically include `date`, `type`, `value`, and `unit`.

### Can I open the exported CSV on Windows?
Yes. CSV is a universal format. You can open the file in Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet software on a Windows PC.

### Does this export include data from my Apple Watch?
Yes. All data that your Apple Watch writes to the Health app on your iPhone is included in the export. This covers heart rate, HRV, workouts, activity rings, blood oxygen, and more.

### How large will my export file be?
This depends entirely on how many years of data you have. For most users, the CSV file will range from 20MB to over 200MB.

### Can I schedule automatic exports?
No, iOS privacy rules require that the user initiate any data export. However, running an export is quick and easy to do on a monthly basis for backups.

### What's the difference between this and a general **[Apple Health data export](/pages/export-apple-health-data/)**?
A general export could refer to XML, JSON, or CSV. This guide focuses specifically on the most common and user-friendly format: CSV. Our app supports all three, but CSV is the best starting point for most people.
