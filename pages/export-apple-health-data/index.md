# How to Export Your Apple Health Data (2025 Full Guide)

The Apple Health app is the central command for your personal health data, from daily activity to critical biometrics captured by your iPhone and Apple Watch. But while this data is immensely valuable, it's also locked inside Apple's ecosystem. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply a curious individual who wants to own a copy of your own data, you need a reliable way to export it. This definitive guide covers all the methods to **export your Apple Health data** in 2025.

## Why Export Your Apple Health Data?

Before we dive into the "how," let's cover the "why." Having a portable copy of your health data empowers you to:

*   **Perform Custom Analysis:** Go beyond the Health app's built-in charts. Use spreadsheets or advanced tools to find trends and correlations unique to you.
*   **Create a Secure Backup:** An independent **[Apple Health data backup](/pages/apple-health-backup/)** protects you from data corruption, accidental deletion, or issues when switching devices.
*   **Share Data with Professionals:** Provide your doctor, trainer, or physical therapist with a detailed dataset they can easily review.
*   **Enhance Academic Research:** For researchers with user consent, exported data provides a rich source for health studies.
*   **Fuel Development Projects:** Developers can use real-world HealthKit data to build and test new applications and services.

## Method 1: The Official Apple Health Export (The Hard Way)

Apple provides a built-in function to export your data. It's comprehensive, but the output is not user-friendly.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1.  **Open the Health App** on your iPhone.
2.  Tap your **profile icon** in the top-right corner.
3.  Scroll to the bottom and tap **Export All Health Data**.
4.  Confirm by tapping **Export**.
5.  Wait for your iPhone to compile the data into a ZIP file. This can take several minutes.
6.  When the Share Sheet appears, save the `health-records.zip` file to your Files app, iCloud, or AirDrop it to a Mac.

**What you get:** Inside the ZIP file is `export.xml`, a massive and complex file containing all your data. This file is difficult to use without technical expertise and usually requires a secondary process to **[convert the Apple Health XML to a usable format like CSV](/pages/convert-apple-health-xml/)**.

## Method 2: "Health Data Export" App (The Easy Way)

A far simpler approach is to use our dedicated iOS app, which is designed to solve the problems of the official method. It provides a direct, one-tap export into clean, analysis-ready formats.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the most useful format to export my health data in?
For most people, CSV is the best choice. It's universally compatible with all spreadsheet software. For developers or data scientists, JSON is often more flexible and powerful.

### Will exporting my data remove it from the Health app?
No. The export process only reads and copies your data. Your original records in the Health app remain untouched.

### How often should I export my health data?
For backup purposes, we recommend a monthly export. If you're actively analyzing your data for a specific goal (e.g., training for a marathon), you might do it weekly.

### Can I export data for a specific date range?
Yes, our "Health Data Export" app allows you to select a specific date range, such as the last month, the last year, or your entire health history.

### Is my data private during this process?
Yes. Our iOS app performs all processing on your device. Your health information is never uploaded to any server. Privacy and security are paramount.

### What's the best way to get the exported file to my computer?
AirDrop is the fastest and easiest method for transferring files from your iPhone to a Mac. Alternatively, you can save the file to iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or Google Drive and access it from any device.
